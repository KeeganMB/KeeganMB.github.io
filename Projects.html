<h1>Projects outside of class</h1>
<p>I have only done one actual project (using HTML) outside of class. I made an art commision website for my fiance who takes commisions. It's unfinished but I'm pretty proud of it, especially since I did it in like our first two or so weeks of class</p>

<p>The nav bar at the top leads to all their respective websites, they don't lead to her actual accounts on there cause I just put the homepage links as placeholders. The four white boxes in the middle were placeholders, clicking on them would take you to another page showing you a page of examples</p>
