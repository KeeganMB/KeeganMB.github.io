<h1>Keegan Buis's Online Bio</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Keegan Buis. I have a passion for coding, especially HTML. I got into coding because I love videogames so much, so it seemed like the natural career selection for me. I have made a few flash games of my own (The quality of which aren't stellar) but I had a lot of fun making. My dream is to one day make an actual video game</p>
